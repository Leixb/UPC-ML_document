\section{Conclusions}%
\label{sec:conclusions}


As a conclusion, we argue that with the data that we possess, we were not able to build a model that accurately predicts the point per game that a college or international player in NBA.

The features that were the best predictors for this task seemed to be the points, win-shares, age and seasons played. Similarly to other studies, we found out that the younger the player is drafted, the best it seems to perform in the NBA. We attribute this, to the fact that players that stay more than one year in college, do not possess the skills to enter the NBA earlier.

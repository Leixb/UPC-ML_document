	abstract = {Since 2006, the so-called one and done rule prevents American high school players from joining the National Basketball Association ({NBA}) without at least 1 year of college basketball experience. While there is debate about the pros and cons of the one and done rule, few studies have fully examined how minimal (or no) college experience relates to performance in the {NBA}. The current study used publicly available offensive and defensive statistics for all players in the {NBA} from 1995 to 2016, to examine the relationship between years of college experience and career success in the {NBA}. Results showed that players with less college experience had better offensive, defensive, and advanced metric (player efficiency rating [{PER}] and value over replacement player [{VORP}]) statistics than players with more college experience. However, players with less college experience also made more mistakes in game play, such as turnovers and fouls. The results suggest that college players may not need to attend college to succeed in the {NBA}.},

	abstract = {he aims of this study were to identify variables which may potentially influence player performance, and to implement a statistical model to study their relative contribution in order to explain two outcomes: points and win score. We used all the possible variables affecting player performance creating a comprehensive database from two sources of statistical information about the {NBA} 2007 regular season: www.basketball-reference.com and www.nbastuffer.com. The data employed for the analysis were composed of 2187 cases (27 players * 81 games), having followed a filtering process. We dealt with a balanced study design with repeated measurements given that each player was observed the same number of games, and therefore the player was considered as a random effect. We carried out mixed models to quantify the variability in points and win score among players. Minutes played, the usage percentage and the difference of quality between teams were the main factors for variations in points made and win score. The interaction between player position and age was important in win score. We encourage managers and coaches of sports teams to choose appropriate methods according to their aims. Future research should take into consideration the use of models with random effects on players' characteristics.},

	abstract = {In recent years, analytics has started to revolutionize the game of basketball: quantitative analyses of the game inform team strategy, management of player health and fitness, and how teams draft, sign, and trade players. In this review, we focus on methods for quantifying and characterizing basketball gameplay. At the team level, we discuss methods for characterizing team strategy and performance, while at the player level, we take a deep look into a myriad of tools for player evaluation. This includes metrics for overall player value, defensive ability, and shot modeling, and methods for understanding performance over multiple seasons via player production curves. We conclude with a discussion on the future of basketball analytics, and in particular highlight the need for causal inference in sports.},

	abstract = {The current study aims to identify differences in the individual profiles of youth basketball players (U-16, U-18, U-20) as well as to understand if this variation is affected by player-related variables or team final classification. To this end, archival data from 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 (n=1152 game box scores) European youth championships is analysed. First, a discriminant analysis is carried out to examine the individual game-related statistics (mean ± {SD}). Secondly, after determining the normality of the data, Kruskal-Wallis is performed to compare differences in performance profiles between different age-groups, teams’ final classification and according to players’ position on the court. The resulting findings show significant differences between the playing positions as well as between different age-groups and considering teams’ final standing position. Older age-groups accumulate higher number in field goals scored, field goal percentage, 3-points scored, efficiency and points scored comparing to younger age-group players. Teams’ final classification also has a significant influence on performance profiles of the players. In both cases, the players from the best teams performed better in most of the statistical variables when compared to bottom-4 teams. Results of the present investigation can help coaches differentiate performance indicators of playing positions and predict how it can change throughout age groups. These findings can be used to optimize preparation for individual players and team’s performance.},
